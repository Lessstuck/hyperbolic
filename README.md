Noneuclidean algorithmic music with a 3D browser interface.

Sound on! Play with it, and discover how it works.

### The Basic Idea
For each of the 3 objects, there are 3 parameters tied to the 3 dimensions of the object's location. While dragging an object, its sound is soloed to make it easier to hear what's being controlled. Some controls are immediate. For example, moving along the x-axis left/right pans the sound left/right. Other controls take time to perceive. For example, moving along the y-axis controls rhythmic parameters. The delayed effect challenges traditional interactivity design. Does it work?

### Design Strategy
#### Goals
• Rhythmically precise
• 3D physics interface
• Musically interesting
• Multiplatform

##### Rhythmically precise
I searched for examples of in-browser musical timing, and this metronome page was the most rhythmically precise.

##### 3D physics interface
Three.js was the obvious choice for all 3D rendering, and cannon-es.js was used for physics. Pointer interaction adapted from this example.

##### Musically interesting
I find that the most interesting musical strucures lie somewhere between completely deterministic and completley random. Stochastic music generators usually require some form of random to decide among parameter values. By using chaos instead of random, a balance of predictable and unpredictable can be achieved. This is achieved with a lookup table of proprietary values generated by Feigenbaum's recursive quadratic chaos generator.

In addition, rhythmic patterns do not follow repeating phrases. This is implemented with my ES module noneuclidean, which exports a Track class. Each track receives global play messages on regular beats. The track decides how many beats to count before returning a 1, causing the instrument to play its sound, or 0, resulting in no sound. The result is a regular/irregularity I find interesting.

##### Multiplatform
Testing on laptop (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) tablet (Safari), phone (Apple & Android). Your bug reports are most welcome.
