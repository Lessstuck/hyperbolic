Sound on! Play with it, and discover how it works.

### The Basic Idea
For each of the 3 objects, there are 3 parameters tied to the 3 dimensions of the object's location. While dragging an object, its sound is soloed to make it easier to hear what's being controlled. Some controls are immediate. For example, moving left/right along the x-axis  pans the sound left/right. Other controls take time to perceive. For example, moving up/down along the y-axis controls rhythmic parameters. The delayed result challenges traditional interactivity design. Does it work?

### Design Strategy
#### Goals
Rhythmically precise • 3D physics interface • Musically interesting • Multiplatform

##### Rhythmically precise
I found a simple but accurate [webAudio-based metronome](http://andrew-yavtushenko.github.io/metronome/) to drive rhythmic pulses, based on the playback of a silent audio buffer, with the .onended property a callback to restart the loop.

##### 3D physics interface
[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) was the obvious choice for all 3D rendering. Pointer interaction using the [cannon-es.js physics engine](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es) adapted from [this example](https://pmndrs.github.io/cannon-es/examples/threejs_mousepick).

##### Musically interesting
I find that the most interesting musical strucures lie somewhere between completely deterministic and completly random. Stochastic music generators require some form of random to decide among parameter values. By using chaos instead of random, a balance of predictable and unpredictable can be achieved. This is achieved with a lookup table of proprietary values generated by [Feigenbaum's recursive quadratic chaos generator](https://sites.google.com/site/poggiolifractalsandchaos/web-diagrams/the-feigenbaum-fractal) and massaged to make for a more even distribution.

In addition, the rhythmic patterns do not follow repeating phrases. This is implemented with my ES module [noneuclidean](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noneuclidean?activeTab=readme), which exports a Track class. Each track receives global play messages on regular beats. The track decides how many beats to count before returning 1, causing the instrument to play its sound, or 0, resulting in no sound. The result is a regular/irregularity I find interesting.

##### Multiplatform
Testing on laptop (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) tablet (Safari), phone (Apple & Android). Your bug reports are most welcome.
